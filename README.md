# todoapp-authentication-system

this code have an authentication system for example:  signup button to navigate to signup page and signin button to navigate to signin page and signout button to log off current user and I use a method to apply authentication on all http requests.
this code store the state of app for each user separately. Enable Todo app to work for anonymous users too.
